## **Abstract** 

_Assembly101 is a new procedural activity dataset featuring 4321 videos of people assembling and disassembling 101 “take-apart” toy vehicles. Participants work without fixed instructions, and the sequences feature rich and natural variations in action ordering, mistakes, and corrections. Assembly101 is the first multi-view action dataset, with simultaneous static (8) and egocentric (4) recordings. Sequences are annotated with more than 100K coarse and 1M fine-grained action segments, and 18M 3D hand poses._ 

_We benchmark on three action understanding tasks: recognition, anticipation and temporal segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel task of detecting mistakes. The unique recording format and rich set of annotations allow us to investigate generalization to new toys, cross-view transfer, long-tailed distributions, and pose vs. appearance. We envision that Assembly101 will serve as a new challenge to investigate various activity understanding problems._ 

## **1. Introduction** 

Assembly and disassembly tasks, like putting together a piece of furniture, or taking apart a home appliance for repair, are common to everyday living. We often rely on paper manuals or online instructional videos to guide us through these tasks. The next generation of smart assistants, together with augmented reality (AR) hardware, can help us in a more embodied setting. Intelligent systems that jointly consider instructions or goals _and_ real-world observations can greatly advance AR applications. Mock-ups and proof-of-concepts already exist for cooking [15], monitoring worker safety [4], visiting museums [11], and learning surgical procedures [3]. To that end, the interest in action understanding tasks such as recognition, anticipation, and temporal segmentation has grown, especially for egocentric views [5, 17, 34]. 

In looking at the benchmarks used in action understand- 

ing, there are datasets of short clips [16, 21, 45], datasets with longer sequences from movies [18, 51] and scripted actions [42, 43, 47], with particular focus on the cooking domain [5, 12, 22, 35, 37, 40, 47, 50]. Most related to our work are instructional video datasets [49, 50, 52]. But these instructional videos are curated from online sources; they are produced, have multiple shots, and primarily target multi-modal (vision + NLP) learning [40, 50, 52]. Few datasets focus on goal-oriented, multi-step activities outside the kitchen domain and are otherwise small-scale [2, 20, 34] or limited in task or sequence diversity [1, 49]. 

We introduce Assembly101: 362 unique sequences of people assembling and disassembling 101 “take-apart” toy vehicles (see Figs. 1, 3). The dataset features recordings from 8 static and 4 egocentric viewpoints, with 4321 sequences totalling 513 hours of footage. Assembly101 is annotated with more than 1M action segments, spanning 1380 fine-grained and 202 coarse action classes. We benchmark on four tasks: _action recognition_ and _anticipation_ centered around hand-object interactions, _temporal action segmentation_ and our newly proposed _mistake detection_ task dedicated to investigating sequence understanding in assembly activities. Assembly101 features three novel aspects currently under-represented in existing video benchmarks: 

- **Goal-oriented free-style procedures:** Existing datasets feature multi-step activities following a strictly ordered recipe [28, 40, 50, 52] or script [8, 12, 34, 43, 47]. Assembly101 depicts non-scripted, goal-oriented activities. 

- **Rich sequence variation:** Participants vary in skill level, and recordings feature realistic variations in action ordering, mistakes, and corrections. Unlike existing skill assessment datasets [7, 13, 31, 33], which have only skill scores, we annotate specific mistakes and participant skill levels. 

- **Synchronized static and egocentric viewpoints:** This unique multi-view setting gives privileged

Figure 1. Assembly101 includes synchronized static multi-view and egocentric recordings of participants assembling and disassembling take-apart toys. Sequences are annotated with fine-grained and coarse actions, 3D hand poses, participants’ skill levels, and mistakes on coarse segments ( _e.g_ . “attach cabin” highlighted in red). 

static information currently missing from egocentric datasets. It also allows for investigating hand-object interactions with full 3D understanding and domaintransfer between different viewpoints. 

## **2. A Comparison of Action Datasets** 

Assembly101 can be characterized by its (1) multi-step content, (2) multi-view recordings and (3) action understanding tasks. We make a coarse comparison to related datasets based on this taxonomy. 

### **2.1. Content: Multi-step activities** 

Multi-step activities are best exemplified in cooking and instructional videos, so the majority of datasets in this area are curated from online video platforms, _e.g_ . YouTube Instructional [1], What’s Cooking [27], YoucookII [50], CrossTask [52], COIN [49] and HowTo100M [29]. Using YouTube videos is appealing due to the sheer amount and variety. However, these videos often do not suit an AR setting due to their “produced” nature, _e.g_ . mixed viewpoints, fast-forwarding, unrelated narrations, etc. Additionally, the majority of these datasets are from the kitchen domain and are primarily composed for studying multi-modal learning in vision and natural language [27, 50, 52]. 

Recorded datasets, _e.g_ . Breakfast [22], GTEA [12], 50Salads [47] are major contributors to the study of multistep activities [9,10,39]. However, they are either small [12, 47] or have little ordering variations [22]. Assembly tasks are a new domain explored in some datasets [2,34], but their limited scale is less ideal for deep learning. 

### **2.2. Viewpoint: Egocentric & multi-view** 

**Egocentric** data offers a unique viewpoint for human activities and is particularly important for wearables, _e.g_ . AR glasses. Small-scale datasets include [12,20,32,34]. Largescale efforts include EPIC-KITCHENS [5, 6] and the re- 

cent Ego4D [17], which expands beyond the kitchen to a wide variety of daily activities. In contrast to these datasets, Assembly101 features both egocentric and thirdperson views, offering simultaneous privileged information from the outside-in as well as multi-view egocentric data for 3D action recognition. 

**Multi-view** fixed-camera datasets include IKEA [2] and Breakfast [22]. We feature a synchronized egocentric stream that allows studying the domain gap between fixed and egocentric views. Moreover, the egocentric head pose is tracked relative to the fixed views, enabling geometric reasoning between the viewpoints. Although CharadesEGO [42] also has both an egocentric and a third-person view of people performing scripted activities, the views are taken asynchronously, _i.e_ . independent recording instances. 

### **2.3. Task** 

**Action recognition:** We focus on fine-grained actions lasting a few seconds within the context of longer activity sequences. This is in contrast to classifying short isolated clips, such as in Kinetics [21] and SomethingSomething [16]. Our task is more similar to EPICKITCHENS [5] and Charades [42, 43], which feature finegrained segments taken from longer daily activity videos with challenging long-tail distributions. 

**Anticipating actions** before they occur is a recently introduced task popularized by EPIC-KITCHENS [5] and Breakfast [22]. A notable difference between these two is the label granularity and hence the anticipation horizon. Anticipation methods for EPIC predict fine-grained actions with a short, few-second long horizon, while Breakfast aims to predict multiple coarse actions with minutes-long horizons. As Assembly101 features multi-granular labels, it can be used for both short- and long-horizon anticipation. 

**Temporal action segmentation** datasets like GTEA [12] and 50Salads [47] are small-scale datasets (28 and 50 videos

respectively). Breakfast [22] is limited in temporal variation, making it less ideal for studying sequencing and ordering as a problem. The assembly actions in our dataset feature repetitions, large deviations in ordering and also require modelling longer-range information. 

**Hand-object interactions** from egocentric views are studied in two new datasets, FPHA [14] and H2O [23]. Unlike EPIC, FPHA and H2O provide 3D pose of one or both hands and 6D pose of the manipulated objects. Recognition from pose is particularly important when the amount of visual data given to the system is limited, _e.g_ . due to privacy concerns. Assembly101 currently offers 3D hand poses for each frame. It offers a much larger set of fine-grained handobject interactions compared to FPHA and H2O. 

**Detecting mistakes** and missed actions by wearable devices could greatly improve wearer’s safety. Anomaly detection in surveillance videos [48] and skill assessment [7, 13, 30, 53] are active research areas, but to the best of our knowledge, detecting mistakes in procedural activities has not been previously studied. The coarse action segments of our assembly sequences are annotated with mistake labels. Closest to our work is [46] on forgotten actions. 

## **3. Recording and Annotation** 

### **3.1. Recording rig** 

We built a desk rig equipped with eight RGB cameras at 1920 _×_ 1080 resolution and four monochrome cameras at 640 _×_ 480 resolution. The RGB cameras are mounted on a scaffold around the desk with 5 overhead and 3 on the side. The monochrome cameras are placed on the four corners of a custom-built headset worn by the participants and provide multiple egocentric views similar to the Oculus Quest VR 

headset. Fig. 2 shows the recording rig and headset, with cameras circled in red. All cameras are synchronized with SMPTE timecode and geometrically calibrated with a fiducial to sub-pixel accuracies. Participants are recorded standing, though taller participants are asked to sit to ensure their hands and the assembled toy is visible in all camera views. 

### **3.2. Participants, toys, & recording protocol** 

**Participants:** We recruited 53 adults (28 males, 25 females) to disassemble and assemble “take-apart” toy vehicles. Each participant was asked to work with six toys in an hour-long recording session, though the final number varies depending on the participant’s speed. 

**Toys:** The sequences feature 101 unique toys from 15 categories of construction, emergency response, and other vehicles. Each category has variations in colour, size, and style of vehicle; across categories, the vehicles have some shared components _e.g_ . construction vehicles feature the same base but different arm attachments. Fig. 3 shows a sample from each vehicle category and the distribution of toys and recordings per category. 

**Protocol:** We are interested in capturing the _natural_ order in which the participants assemble and disassemble the toys, so we placed only an image of the fully assembled toy on the table for reference. We did not provide instructions nor specify a part ordering<sup>1</sup> . This design choice makes the assembly task more challenging but also more realistic, resulting in great variation in action ordering. Preliminary recordings showed that some participants struggled with the assembly task. For time-efficiency, we adjusted the protocol to have participants first disassemble a completed toy before proceeding to “re”-assemble. 

### **3.3. Annotations** 

**Action labels:** We label two granularities of actions and their start and end times. **_Fine-grained actions_** are handobject interactions based on a single verb or movement and an interacting object or toy part. A fine-grained action spans two or three stages: (1) pre-contact when the hand (and tool) starts approaching the object, (2) the interaction, and (3) post-contact when the object is released. Additionally, we merge several co-occuring or sequential finegrained actions into **_coarse actions_** related to the attaching or detaching of a vehicle part. For example, the coarse action _“detach bumper”_ consists of four fine-grained actions _{“unscrew bumper with screwdriver”, “remove screw from bumper”, “pick up bumper”, “put down bumper”}_ . The fine-grained actions may overlap with each other as participants often multi-task, _e.g_ ., _“put down cabin”_ and _“pick up screwdriver”_ , while the coarse actions are contiguous. Please see Supplementary for details on annotator training and our custom interface for labelling the actions. 

> 1 _e.g_ . Meccano [34] provides participants with an ordered list of steps.

**3D hand poses:** We perform hand tracking from the four monochrome egocentric cameras using a modified version of MegATrack [19] to estimate 3D hand poses of both hands. First, we fuse features from all views into a shared latent space [36]. Then, we regress the joint angles and global transformation for each hand before obtaining landmarks on the fingertips, joints and palm center via forward kinematics. The tracker is trained end-to-end on the dataset from [19]. After egocentric tracking, we extract the 3D keypoint locations (21 per hand) in world coordinates as our pose representation (see Fig. 1). 

## **4. Dataset Statistics** 

### **4.1. Recording statistics** 

Our key motivation was to gather a large and diverse procedural activity dataset with varying label granularities. Assembly101 features 362 disassembly-assembly sequences; each sequence is recorded from 12 viewpoints, totalling 4321 videos and 513 hours of footage. The average sequence or video duration is 7.1 _±_ 3.4 minutes (Fig. 4 left). Tables 1 and 2 show comparisons with similar recorded datasets. Assembly101 is considerably larger with more than 1M fine-grained and 100K coarse segments, making it the largest procedural activity dataset to date. 

### **4.2. Fine-grained actions** 

From our 15 toy categories, we define 90 objects, _e.g_ ., wheel, including 5 tools together with the _“hand”_ . Additionally, we specify 24 interaction verbs. The objects and interaction verbs form a total of 1380 fine-grained action labels. Fig. 4 shows the duration distribution. The average fine-grained action lasts 1.7 _±_ 2 seconds. In a single disassembly-assembly sequence, there are an average 236.7 _±_ 98.4 fine-grained actions. The entire dataset totals more than 1M fine-grained action instances. The distribution of objects and verbs is provided in the Supplementary. There is a natural long tail, where 30% of the data accounts for 1238 (89%) of the fine-grained actions. **Comparison with other datasets:** Table 1 gives a de- 

tailed numerical comparison with other fine-grained action datasets. Assembly101 has 23-44 _×_ more action classes and 56-111 _×_ more action segments than assembly-style datasets IKEA and Meccano. Assembly101’s scale is comparable to other large-scale egocentric datasets such as EPIC-KITCHENS and Ego4D. Compared to EPIC, Assembly101’s has 1.7 _×_ more egocentric footage and 11 _×_ more action segments. In the labelled footage of Ego4D, the closest subtask of “forecasting” features 120 hours of annotated temporal action labels. In comparison, our dataset has 12 _×_ more action segments than Ego4D. 

### **4.3. Coarse actions** 

Each coarse action is defined by the assembly or disassembly of a vehicle part. There are 202 coarse actions composed of 11 verbs and 61 objects. Each video sequence features an average of 24 coarse actions. The average coarse action comprises 10 fine-grained actions and lasts 16.5 _±_ 15.7 seconds (see distribution in Fig. 4). We also define the tail classes for the coarse labels where the 30% of the data accounts for 171 (84%) of the coarse actions. 

**Comparison with other datasets:** While coarse actions can also be used for classification, we consider them sequentially and use them for action segmentation. Table 2 compares Assembly101 with Breakfast & 50Salads, two contemporary segmentation benchmarks. We have 2.5 _×_ more videos, 6.7 _×_ more hours of footage, 9.3 _×_ more action segments and 4.2 _×_ more action classes than Breakfast. **Temporal dynamics:** We define and report two scores in Table 3 to quantify the temporal dynamics. The **repetition score** is defined as 1 _− ui/gi_ where _ui_ is the number of unique actions in video _i_ , and _gi_ is the total number of actions and results in a score in the range [0 _,_ 1). 0 indicates no repetition, and the closer the score is to 1, the more repetition that occurs in the sequence. Averaged over all video sequences, we have a repetition score of 0.18, with higher repetition (0.23) in assembly than disassembly (0.11). Compared with Breakfast and 50Salad, our dataset includes 1.6 _×_ and 2.3 _×_ more repeated steps, respectively. We compute the **order variation** as the average edit dis-

This score has a range [0 _,_ 1]; a score of 1 corresponds to no deviations in ordering between pairs. The relatively high scores of Breakfast, 0.15, indicate that actions following a strict ordering, making it less attractive to study temporal sequence dynamics than 50Salads (0.02) and Assembly101 (0.05). Overall, our dataset includes a high frequency of repeated steps and variations in temporal ordering both in assembly and disassembly sequences, which are characteristic of daily procedural activities, and therefore contributes a challenging benchmark for modelling the temporal relations between actions.

recognizing mistakes. Of the 60k coarse actions in assembly, 15.9% and 6.7% segments are mistake and corrective segments, respectively. Skill is closely related, but datasets focusing on skill assessment assign a score to short clips of _e.g_ . drawing [7] or suturing [53] instead of determining what and when the mistake occurs. We also annotated the skill level of the participant in our videos from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Overall, the distribution of skill labels in our sequences is 9%, 6%, 13%, 25% and 47% from worst to best. 

### **4.5. 3D hand poses** 

As Assembly101 features hand-object interactions, 3D hand pose is an important modality, especially since AR/VR systems often provide this information [19]. Compared with FPHA [14] & H2O [23], our dataset includes 82 _×_ more segments and 200 _×_ more frames, reported in Table 4. 

### **4.4. Mistake actions** 

Even though our participants are adults assembling children’s toys, they still make mistakes and then need to make corrections before proceeding. For example, putting on the cabin before attaching the interior (see Fig. 1), making it impossible to place the interior after, so one must remove the cabin as a corrective action before placing the interior. We annotate the coarse assembly segments with a parallel set of labels _{“correct”, “mistake”, “correction”}_ . 

Mistakes are natural occurrences in many tasks and an opportunity for an AR assistant to provide help. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing action datasets for 

### **4.6. Training, validation & test splits** 

We use the 60%, 15% and 25% of the videos for creating our training, validation and test splits, respectively, with detailed statistics given in Supplementary. For more robust evaluation, we will withhold the test split ground truths to be used in online submission leaderboards. The validation and test sets are structured to help assess generalization to new toys and actions and the participants’ skills. 25 of the 101 toys are shared across training, validation and test splits. There are also toy instances that are not a part of the training set to facilitate zero-shot learning.

## **5. Benchmark Experiments** 

We benchmark and present baselines for four action tasks: recognition, anticipation, temporal segmentation and our newly defined mistake recognition. However, as the data is very rich, it is our hope that the extended community will find other uses and tasks for the dataset after its release. Due to limited space, we highlight some key results in this section and defer the architecture, implementation and detailed comparison of results to the Supplementary. 

### **5.1. Recognition, anticipation & segmentation** 

**For action recognition** (Table 5), we define a classification task on the fine-grained action classes, using pre-trimmed clips based on the annotated start and end times. We train a state-of-the-art video recognition model, TSM [25], and two top-performing graph convolutional networks on poses, 2s-AGCN [41] and MS-G3D [26]. Performance is evaluated by Top-1 accuracies for verb, object and action classes. **Action anticipation** (Table 5), predicts upcoming finegrained actions _τ_ = 1 second into the future. We train a state-of-the-art model TempAgg [38]. Performance is evaluated by class-mean Top-5 recall as per [6]. 

**Temporal action segmentation** (Table 7) assigns framewise action labels to a video sequence. We apply two competing state-of-the-art temporal convolutional networks: MS-TCN++ [24] and C2F-TCN [44], using frame-wise fea- 

tures extracted from TSM [25] trained for action recognition on Assembly as input. Performance is evaluated by mean frame-wise accuracy (MoF), segment-wise edit distance (Edit) and F1 scores at overlapping thresholds of 10%, 25%, and 50%, denoted by F1@10, 25, 50. 

These three challenges form the basis for understanding actions at various granularities. Compared to the existing datasets, Assembly101 shows great potential for extending video understanding to new challenging natural procedural activities by uniting multi-view recognition, generalization to new tasks, long-tail distributions, different skill levels and sequences with mistakes in one dataset. 

### **5.2. Camera viewpoints** 

We train the models on the instances from both fixed and egocentric views but report the performance on each view separately in Tables 5 and 7. Unsurprisingly, fixed viewpoints perform better than egocentric viewpoints, with a difference of 16.2% in _“Overall”_ recognition, 4.9% recall in _“Overall”_ anticipation and 6.5% MoF in segmentation. These differences highlight the challenging nature of recognizing actions from the egocentric point of view. 

Table 6 compares Top-1 action recognition accuracy on the individual camera views. Overhead cameras v4 and v1 have the highest accuracy while side cameras v5 and v7 have the lowest, with a drop of 16% and 11% from v4.

In egocentric views, the lower headset cameras, e3 and e4 achieve higher accuracies than e1 and e2, which do not fully capture the table. The accuracies of e3 and e4, however, are still more than 10% lower than that of v4. 

Table 6 shows that there is a large domain gap if we train the models on only egocentric or fixed view sequences and cross-test rather than training on both sources of data. TSM trained only on fixed views performs significantly worse on egocentric views and vice versa. This indicates a significant mismatch and presents a new challenge for studying the domain gap on paired egocentric and third-person actions. 

### **5.3. Head vs. tail classes** 

A separate tally in Table 5 reveals a significant gap of 37% between head and tail action accuracy for **recognition** . The drop in tail verbs is much less than objects (18% vs. 42% drop). Similarly, the action **anticipation** performance on head classes is quite high, with a 28% recall in Table 5. It is significantly larger than _“Overall”_ action recall by 19.2%. This large difference could be due to the evaluation metric where the class-mean balances the longtail distribution as 89% of action classes are tail classes. Similarly, we evaluate the tail and head class MoF for temporal action segmentation. According to this the MoF of the tail classes is 51.5% which is much higher than the tail MoF of 7.2%. The low tail performance scores encourage developing few-shot action recognition methods. 

### **5.4. Seen vs. unseen, assembly vs. disassembly** 

Assembly101 can be used to study generalization to new assembly tasks through the _“Unseen”_ toys. Both Tables 5 and 7 show that _“Seen”_ toys score higher than _“Unseen”_ ones for action recognition, anticipation and segmentation. For recognition and anticipation, there is little difference in verb scores, but a large gap for objects, as all verbs are shared whereas objects are not (13% unseen objects). 

We separate the evaluation for assembly vs. disassembly 

Table 8. **Action recognition** on 3D hand poses. 

|**Method**|**verb**|**object**|**action**|

portion of the sequences in Table 7 for action segmentation. The MoF and segment scores of the assembly portion is consistently lower than disassembly sequences, likely due to its higher complexity, as the disassembly portions have fewer ordering variations and no mistakes. Overall, the F1 and Edit scores do not show a significant over-segmentation effect compared to disassembly sequences even though the assembly tasks are more complex. 

### **5.5. 3D pose-based action recognition** 

Another objective for collecting Assembly101 was to investigate action recognition using 3D hand poses. Hand poses are commonly available in AR/VR systems and are significantly more compact representations than video features. Table 8 compares 3D pose-based to video-based recognition. _“2s-AGCN [41]”_ classifies trimmed segments bounded by action start and end [ _ts, te_ ]. _“2s-AGCN [41] w/ context”_ extends each boundary by 0.5 seconds; the extension improves action accuracy significantly. State-of-the-art “MS-G3D [26] w/ context” achieves the highest action performance of 28.7%, though this is still 5.1% lower than the video-based _“TSM egocentric (fuse 4 views)”_ , where predictions from the four egocentric views are fused by average voting. Interestingly, the verb accuracy for pose-based recognition is 6.7% higher than video-based, while its object score is 10.2% lower than video-based. This is unsurprising as hand poses can easily encode movements but cannot provide much object information. We also add an oracle experiment incorporating ground truth object labels as onehot encoded frame-level features and train a TempAgg [38] model on top. As shown in Table 8, _“Object GT”_ alone achieves a high object but poor verb accuracy. Fusing it with

Figure 5. Influence of skill on segmentation. “d” stands for disassembly and “a” for assembly. Participants with less skills, “a1 & a2”, have lower scores in assembly sequences. 

“MS-G3D [26] w/ context” results in a significant jump in action accuracy. We leave as future work the joint modeling of 3D objects and hand poses for action recognition. 

3D poses have the additional advantage of less sensitivity to domain gaps between different environments. For video-based models, training features from scratch requires considerable amounts of time and data, but using features extracted from pre-trained networks may not always generalize. Table 9 compares TempAgg [38] trained on the features extracted from TSM networks pre-trained on Kinetics400 [21], Something-Something [16], EPIC-KITCHENS100 [6] and Assembly101 for view _“v1”_ . TSM features pretrained on EPIC-KITCHENS perform significantly better than the other datasets; though there is still a gap of 23.2% compared to pre-training on the native Assembly101. This indicates a considerable domain gap between our dataset and the existing action recognition benchmarks. On the other hand, poses are low-dimensional common representations independent of the domain and therefore outperform the scores from the other datasets by a significant margin. 

### **5.6. Skill level** 

Fig. 5 compares the segmentation scores for different skill levels from 1 (least skilled) to 5 (most skilled) in both disassembly and assembly sequences, indicated by the prefixes _“d”_ and ‘ _“a”_ , respectively. Results show that the skill level has little impact on the disassembly sequences. For the least skilled groups _“a1 & a2”_ , however, segmentation scores for assembly sequences are significantly lower than disassembly, likely due to the high ordering variations and mistake segments. 

### **5.7. Mistake detection** 

Identifying mistakes requires modelling procedural knowledge and retaining long-range sequence information. As input, we provide video sequences represented by framewise features from the start of the assembly sequence to the (end of the) current coarse action segment. The task is predicting if the current segment belongs to one of the three classes of _{“correct”, “mistake”, “correction”}_ . We apply the long-range video model TempAgg [38] using TSM features and evaluate per-class Top-1 precision and Top-1 

Table 10. Mistake detection results. 

|||**Mista**|**ke**|**Correc**|**tion**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Task**|**Features**|precision|recall|precision|recall|
|Recognition|GT coarse|48.6|62.7|65.6|84.9|
||TSM|30.8|46.6|30.8|29.6|
|Early prediction|TSM|29.3|35.0|26.5|26.4|



recall under two settings: _“Recognition”_ , which gets the entire coarse segment and _“Early prediction”_ , which gets half of the segment. Due to the imbalanced class distribution, we penalize the models more for misclassifying “mistake” and “correction” classes. As an oracle baseline, we use the ground truth coarse action labels, _“GT coarse”_ as input. **Baseline results:** Table 10 shows the challenge in detecting mistakes - even using the ground truth coarse action labels as input, the recall for mistakes and corrections is only around 62.7% and 84.9% respectively. With TSM input features, the recall is currently only around 46.6% and 29.6% once the segment of interest ends. Early prediction results in a further 11.6% and 3.2% drop. 

## **6. Conclusion** 

In this paper, we presented Assembly101, the largest procedural activity dataset to date. Our dataset includes synchronized egocentric and static viewpoints for crossview domain analysis, multi-granular action segments and mistake labels to study goal-oriented sequence learning and 3D hand poses to advance 3D hand-object interaction recognition. We defined four challenges, action recognition, action anticipation, temporal action segmentation and mistake detection, to evaluate a wide range of aspects of assembly tasks, including generalization to new toys, cross-view transfer, long-tailed distributions, skill level and pose vs. appearance. Existing methods show promising results but are still far from tackling these challenges with high precision, as observed in the oracle experiments, leaving room for future explorations. 

Assembly101 can be used for many different applications. In this paper, we proposed several directions such as training the next generation of smart assistants to recognize what a user is doing, predict subsequent steps as they watch an assembly task, check for non-compliant steps and give alerts or offer help. We hope that the community will find other applications and tasks for our dataset after its release.
